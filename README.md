# data-sourcing-challenge

## The source code ## is in `retrieve_data.ipynb` within the `starter code` directory. ##

Summary of how I generated the code for this assignment: 

For this assignment, I leveraged the foundational concepts learned during the Module Six class activities. I reviewed the materials from Day One, Day Two, and Day Three to ensure a solid understanding of the required techniques. Additionally, I experimented with various coding approaches to optimize the data retrieval process. I also consulted relevant documentation and resources to enhance my implementation. Ultimately, this combination of class learnings and independent research allowed me to develop a robust solution for the data sourcing challenge.
